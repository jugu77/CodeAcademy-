/* select *

-- What are the distinct neighborhoods?

/* select distinct neighborhood

-- What are the distinct cuisine types?

/*select distinct cuisine

-- Suppose we would like some Chinese takeout.
--What are our options?

/*select *
from nomnom 
where cuisine = 'Chinese';*/

--Return all the restaurants with reviews of 4 and above
/*select *

--Suppose Abbi and Ilana want to have a fancy dinner date.
--Return all the restaurants that are Italian and $$$.

/* select *
